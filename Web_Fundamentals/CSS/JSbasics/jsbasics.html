				<h3>JavaScript Basics</h3>
				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of difference directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web broswer or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="itemtitle">Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;</li>

					<li><span class="itemtitle">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span class="example"> var x = 10;</span> </li>

					<li><span class="itemtitle">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span class="example"> true </span> or <span class="example"> false; </span> null - <span class="example"> null </span> aka nothing; Number - <span class="example"> 42 </span> or <span class="example"> 3.14159; </span> String - <span class="example"> "Coding Dojo Rocks!";</span> Array - <span class="example"> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; </span> and Object - <span class="example"> {first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'} </span> </li>

					<li><span class="itemtitle">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span class="example"> if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span class="example"> else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span class="example"> else </span> we execute this block of code; </li>

					<li><span class="itemtitle">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop! </li>

					<li><span class="itemtitle">Functions</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
